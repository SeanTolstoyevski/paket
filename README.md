## 🔊 Informations

Hey,  
this is not for archiving your files like 7-zip.

We recommend that you take a look at the items below before using this module.  
The world of encryption is a **complex  topic**. It is important to know what you are doing and what this module actually does.

* Is it really secure? How secure is it?

Frankly the person who wants to get the data can crack anything if tries. Especially if the program you are distributing runs directly on the user's computer and all data is with the program. However, what AES and Package do is complex enough.  
Don't Remember, **every executable file is sensitive to disassembly**.  
You can pass your files through other complex processes before encrypting them. However, this causes your program to load files into memory slowly at run time.

* What encryption algorithm does it use?

AES CFB, CTR, GCM, OFB.  
If enough people write to add new algorithms, we will add new algorithms to the extent that golang supports it.

## What does it do?

Imagine you are producing a game. You will probably have carefully designed animations and sound effects. You do not want users to receive this data.  
If we think for this scenario; The package encrypts the files in the specified folder using AES with a key you specify. And it combines all encrypted files into a single file. Calculates the hash of the encrypted and unencrypted version of the file. Saves to a table. This is a little shield for people trying to deceive you.  
Then, you can easily retrieve the decoded or encrypted version of your file from the encrypted file.  
Normally you should create a system to securely encrypt and decrypt your files.  
This is a ready system 😎 .

## Installation

This module consists of two parts:
1. CMD tool – command-line tool for encrypting and packaging files.
2. "pengine" (paket engine) – subfolder that provides low-level APIs (reading encrypted datas, verifications etc...).

To create a paket you need to install  cmd tool:  
`go get -u github.com/SeanTolstoyevski/paket`


This install installs all dependencies. Golang compiles the package tool to your GOPATH/bin directory.

You can type `paket -help` to be sure of the installation.  
If you don't see anything, the **paket could not be installed**.

## First paket creation and CMD tool

We can read the **help text** to understand some things.  
The help text is simple and self explanatory.

```cmd
...>paket -help
Usage of paket:
  -a    anonymize file names. For example, the ''lion.zip'' file is written to the table with a name such as ''201bce5f''
  -f string
        Folder containing files to be encrypted. It is not recursive, Subfolders is not encrypted.
  -i uint
        Iteration count for pbkdf2. For less than 4096, 4096 will be selected.
        For modern CPUs values like 100000 may be appropriate. (default 4096)
  -k string
        Key for encrypting files. If this parameter is null, the tool generates one randomly byte  and prints value to the console.
  -m string
        The mode to be selected for encryption. Currently ''CFB'', ''CTR'', ''GCM'' and ''OFB'' are supported. (default "gcm")
  -o string
        The file to which your encrypted data will be written. If there is a file with the same name, you will be warned. (default "data.pack")
  -s    prints progress steps to the console. For example, which file is currently encrypting, etc. (default true)
  -t string
        The go file to be written for Paket to read. When compiling this file, you must import it into your program.
        It is created as "package main." (default "PaketTable.go")
```

***

You can review the list  below for more information and to know what's going on behind.

* `-a`

The Go compiler leaks many strings during compilation. You can view these strings in a simple hex editor or a code editor like Notepad++.  
When the names of your files are guessed, it's easier for those trying to tamper with the program.  
This was not designed to make the process impossible. Just an extra step.  
It can be enabled with `-a=1`. This will create a file named **anonymization-information.txt** in your working directory.  
Note: these names  are completely randomized. It is nothing like the hex encoding of the filename.  
Important note: giving up the readable names of your files can complicate the writing of the program.

* `-f`

The folder with the files we want to package.  
Subfolders will not be included.  
The name of these files is written to the table without the name of the folder.  
So when you think about it, the data1.eng file in the /datas folder is not written as data/data1.eng.  
If you suspect your filenames have been leaked and their purpose has been compromised, you can examine the "-a" flag.

* `-i`

In modern technologies, using a plaintex key is equivalent to suicide.  
PBDFK2 creates a much more complex brute forge scenario by repeatedly hashing the key in the specified number loop. Now instead of plaintex key, a key that has been hashed 12000 times is used.  
The person trying to guess the key must know the iteration, find the salt, and guess the hash function correctly. All of this complicates the process.  
You can choose an iteration number by performing the appropriate tests according to the architecture you are targeting.  
For modern CPUs, hashing and loops appear to be simple functions. For this reason, values above 50000 can be considered good. However, relying only on PBDFK2 is not very accurate either.
